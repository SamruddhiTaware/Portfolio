        <div class="problem">
        <h2> The Problem </h2>
        <p style="color: black"> The problem with the existing system is the constant back and forth of
            e-mails and opening of attachments. Once the client sends the Account Opening Kit and required <br>
            documentation, it is constantly e-mailed between the bank’s front and back office for authorization.
            It is important to note that clients do not always send the complete <br> account opening kit or necessary
            documentation. Sometimes required fields are left blank, ID’s are missing, signatures are ineligible,
            or documents are expired. <br> This creates extra layers to the process that involve even more
            e-mails between departments to request pending or missing information.
            Remember, the front and back <br> office mostly deal with issues pertaining to existing accounts which
            constitute a bulk of their daily activities. Account openings are just a small percentage of what the <br>
            bank does. E-mails can very easily be lost or forgotten as they pile on top of one another.
            This creates an operational risk in which account opening requests and documentation <br> may be delayed,
            neglected, and possibly lost due to a lack of a proper tracking system.
        </p>
            <h2> Proposed Solution </h2>
            <p style="color: black"> Proposed solution was the development of a workflow system that will transmit
                and track the flow of documentation and communication related to the account opening process.<br>
                The system
                will be web based, accessible only through the bank’s intranet, and used internally by the
                departments that process account opening requests. Clients will not have <br> access to this system.<br><br>
                Each request for a new account will generate a ticket with a unique identifying number. This
                ticket will be used to transfer information and documentation back and forth <br> between the front
                and back office. They will be able to designate which of the four departments to send the ticket
                to (Corporate, CIAS, Compliance, or Management). <br> Each department – with the exception of Management
                – will have a checklist with requirements that need to be fulfilled before the ticket can move forward.
                Whenever <br> an action is required due to pending, incomplete, or incorrect information, the system
                will automatically generate notifications to those responsible so that they can <br> attend to the issue.<br><br>
                This will ensure that anything related to account opening will be found in one location with
                historical data that shows the flow or stoppage of flow in any particular instance <br> in the process.
                Execution dates and times will be maintained to assist with the tracking.
            </p>
            <h2> Post Interview Analysis </h2>
            <p style="color: black"> After conducting an interview through a video conference with all of the stakeholders
                involved including: Corporate, CIAS, Compliance, and IT. Follow-up phone interviews <br> were conducted with
                Corporate, CIAS, and Management to ask new questions or to clarify questions asked during the video conference.
                Below are the systems requirements <br> that were discussed:

            <ul style="color: black">
                <li> Corporate will be responsible for opening tickets </li>
                <li> Corporate will be responsible for uploading documents</li>
                <li> Corporate, CIAS, and Compliance should be able to edit and submit the tickets also they should
                    have function to <br> return the tickets if more information is required </li>
                <li> Corporate, CIAS, and Compliance should have the function to return tickets if more information is required </li>
                <li> Corporate, CIAS, Compliance, and Management should all be able to comment on the ticket to provide specific
                    instructions </li>
                <li> Corporate, CIAS, Compliance, and Management should all be able to view ticket history</li>
                <li>Compliance will be responsible for sending ticket to management for approval</li>
                <li> Management will approve or reject ticket</li>
                <li> CIAS will close ticket</li>
                <li> System should send a notification when an action is required to which department is responsible</li>
            </ul>
