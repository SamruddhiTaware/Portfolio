        <div class="introduction">
        <p>
            Iâ€™m Samruddhi Taware (Sam), a graduate student at Pace University studying MS in Information Systems.
            On completing my undergraduate degree in Engineering (Information Technology), I went on to work as an
            Analyst at a startup Examsy. Here, I noticed that there is a big gap between people and technology.<br><br>

            I felt that analysts are quite often undervalued and overlooked. Since then,
            I chose to study the importance of analysts in any technology related product.

            To get a more in-depth understanding of information systems I chose to pursue my masters.<br><br>
            During my second semester, I came across User Experience and Design field. I am glad that I stumbled upon
            this course and right away I realized that I had a strong inclination towards the UX domain!
            I loved the way a simple perspective puts up such a different impact on our minds.
            Since then I have always been passionate about UX and have loved to put this in practice here at CariClub.
            Now, I think that I am more close to my goal of bridging the gap between people and technology.
            I seek visual challenges from a designers perspective and look forward to putting my creative thoughts for
            designing user-centric designs.<br><br>

            In my free time, I like to explore new places and try different food types or simply have a good nap
            with my pet :)
            <br><br>
