        <div class="introduction">
        <p>
            Iâ€™m Samruddhi Taware (Sam), a graduate student at Pace University studying MS in Information Systems.
            Right after I completed my undergraduate degree in Engineering (Information Technology),
            I came across a strong intuitive thing about bridging the gaps between people and technology.<br><br>

            I felt that analysts are quite often not given the amount of importance that they deserve and
            I have a mission to redefine the importance of analysts in any technology related product.

            To get a more in-depth understanding of information systems I chose to pursue my masters.<br><br>
            I have been glad that I came across User Experience and Design field. I loved the way a
            simple perspective puts up such a different impact on our minds.
            Since then I have always been passionate about UX and have loved to put this in practice here at CariClub.
            Now, I think that I am more close to my goal of bridging the gap between people and technology.
            I seek visual challenges from a designers perspective and look forward to putting my creative thoughts for
            designing user-centric designs.<br><br>

            If you would like to discuss more about designs,
            my works or even just wanna grab a cup of coffee,
            feel free to reach out to me at <a href ="mailto:st29644n@pace.edu">st29644n@pace.edu</a> or
            <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samruddhi-taware/">LinkedIn.</a>
